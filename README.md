## Paper: Measuring Identity-Based Oppression via Rule-Guided Prompting of Large Language Models
[Paper in Progress]

### Abstract 

This study introduces a novel methodology to model systemic oppression of ethnic groups across global contexts using instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) on free-text self-identification of ethnicity and country. Traditional measures of systemic oppression often rely on structured indices that privilege material resources while overlooking lived, identity-based exclusion. Drawing on a multilingual COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy dataset, we construct a five-level schema of oppression grounded in sociological theory and generated expert-annotated benchmarks across 334 responses spanning ten countries. We then evaluated the synthetic scores generated from three LLMs–Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-3.5-turbo, and GPT-4o-mini–with expert-annotated ground truth values, alongside three different prompting strategies to test the effects of chain-of-thought prompting and assignment rules: a basic prompt (Vanilla), chain-of-thought prompting (CoT), and a novel rubric-based prompt designed to enforce historically grounded, context-sensitive reasoning (Rule-Guided). Our results show that Gemini 1.5 Pro achieved the strongest alignment with human annotations under the Rule-Guided approach (MAE = 0.401; $r$ = 0.852), with rubric-based specifications consistently improving alignment with human ratings across all models relative to Vanilla and CoT prompts. Additionally, sociopolitical complexity is a key factor affecting LLM performance, with reliable results in Western countries like the United States and Canada, but model divergence seen in cases like Algeria and Madagascar. These findings underscore the promises and limitations of using LLMs for sociological classification in public health datasets, highlighting their potential when guided by transparent, theory-informed frameworks.
